Host Testing
=============

This directory contains tests that
can be run directly on the host. In principle,
any portable code can be tested this way, which
keeps us from having to invent elaborate target
testing harnesses in most cases. Hopefully this
shortens the build/test/debug cycle for code
that doesn't need to twiddle hardware bits.
