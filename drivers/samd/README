This is the collection of drivers necessary for
peripheral interoperation with Microchip/Atmel SAMD
series microcontrollers.

Common development platforms include the
SAMD21G18 (armv6m, 48MHz: Arduino Zero, Adafruit Feather M0) and
SAMD51J18 (armv7m, 120MHz, FP: Arduino Metro M4, Adafruit Feather M4).

These drivers were developed using the following spec sheet:

The SERCOM drivers reqiure at least the generic clock controller ('gclk')
drivers for operation.
