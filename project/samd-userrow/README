Running 'make' here will generate an ELF
object that can be loaded onto a Microchip SAMD
MCU in order to re-program the NVM 'User Row' memory.

If you have a SAM MCU with chip-erase or bootloader protection
enabled, you'll need to reprogram the User Row before you're
able to rewrite the contents of the on-board flash.

An easy way to re-program the NVM memory is to use
a debugger that exposes a GDB server, and then run
'load userrow.elf' in GDB to program the memory.
